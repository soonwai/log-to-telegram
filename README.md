# log-to-telegram-bot
A simple python script that monitors a log file for strings and sends notifications to Telegram.

# Introduction
I started learning Python not long ago and thought that I may as well write something that I would use. This is the fruit of my first few days of Python. I know, it's fairly rough.

I use this to follow my Minecraft server's log. Everytime my kids or their friends connect, I get a notification. Awesome.

Of course, you can use it to monitor any log file.

# Dependencies
- telegram-send (https://pypi.org/project/telegram-send/)
